### Authentication & Authorization
- API key-based authentication with rotation support
- IP whitelisting support for restricted access
- Rate limiting with sliding windows and burst handling
- Request correlation tracking for audit trails
- Enterprise-grade authentication mechanisms

### Command Execution Security
- Command allowlisting (only pre-approved commands allowed)
- Path traversal protection against directory traversal attacks
- Advanced input sanitization preventing injection attacks
- Working directory restrictions for sandboxed execution
- Command timeout enforcement preventing hanging processes
- Output size limits preventing memory exhaustion

### File Operations Security
- Path validation and sanitization
- Directory traversal attack prevention
- System directory access restrictions
- Permission handling and metadata preservation
- Automatic directory creation for safe operations

### Network Security
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Environment variable configuration
- Secure defaults (localhost only)
- SSH key authentication for remote operations
- Connection timeout controls
